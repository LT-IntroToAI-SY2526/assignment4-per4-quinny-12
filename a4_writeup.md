# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was creating the has_won function because it was difficult to come up with an efficient solution that wouldn't require if statements for every possible row, column, or diagonal.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    Once again, I'm sure this isn't the most efficient way because it would take forever but this is all I can think of: make if statements for every situation to tell it what move would be the best move to make.
